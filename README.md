# Portable Backend Boilerplate - GraphQL

This codebase is a boilerplate for creating GraphQL applications. It is intended to be used as a module for 
my [Launch pads](https://github.com/launch-pads). However, that being said, it can still be used completely on its own.

In order for a portable boilerplate to work with a Launch pad, it must abide by the following guidelines:
> <https://github.com/portable-boilerplates/guidelines>

This boilerplate contains the following development tooling:
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

#### Requirements (If not using Docker):

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

#### Developers:

- [Jared Jewitt](https://jared-jewitt.github.io/)

## Getting Started

Run the app via either option below, then visit your server at `http://localhost:5000`

##### **With Docker**

```
docker-compose up
```

##### **Without Docker**

1. Download and run  [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

2. Edit [.env.development](.env.development) and [.env.test](.env.test) to use the the non-docker `DATABASE_URL`

```
npm install
npm run start
```

## Commands

> Note: To use these commands with Docker, run them like such: \
> `docker-compose exec -it server npm run ...` (make sure the container is running).

## Environment Variables

Please note the [.env.development](.env.development) and [.env.test](.env.test) files. These values should only be 
used for running the app locally (which is why they're committed to git). If you are deploying this app, it is expected
you use a `.env.production` file (git ignored), or specify env vars on the hosted server.
